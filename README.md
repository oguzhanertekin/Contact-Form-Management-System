CFMS has 3 different user roles: admin, reader and user. Users can enter the form panel and write their name, gender, country and send their messages to the system without the need for any login process. Admins and readers can list the messages received in the system, click on the messages to see the details of that message, or delete the message. Admins can list users in the reader role, view the reader's details by clicking on the reader, or add a new reader to the system and edit the information of existing readers. Additionally, admins can report and view messages in the form of charts by category.
